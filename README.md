# Nuclear Bombs

This project was built in the middle of the course.
The task was to build a website that allows managing a system for saving atomic bomb data, creating a UI, server and database.

The comments and the entire process are in a saved repository, so here is only the code, without the comments and the development process.
The project uses many technologies, including:
React, Typescript, CRUD operations, Express, Postgres, Cloud, etc...
